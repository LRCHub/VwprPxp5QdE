```lrc
[00:33.48] This is your life
[00:35.82] And I won't try to read your mind
[00:40.07] But the way your hand fits into mine
[00:44.46] I won't second-guess, it's a sign
[00:50.79] And if you're serious
[00:52.99] Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
[00:57.39] I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
[01:01.71] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[01:07.84] Give it some time
[01:10.73] And I'll try to remember my lines
[01:14.80] Watch the way your plans turn into mine
[01:19.00] To match the photo that's stuck in my mind
[01:25.35] And if you're serious
[01:27.94] Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
[01:31.94] I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
[01:36.25] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[01:42.41] (And if you're serious)
[01:51.32] (And if you're serious)
[01:56.20] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[01:59.77] If this is your life
[02:02.61] Then all that matters lives in your mind
[02:06.49] And the truth is up for you to define
[02:10.81] I hope that you choose to be mine
[02:17.11] And if you're serious
[02:19.56] Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
[02:23.79] I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
[02:28.61] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[02:37.27] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[02:45.96] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[02:51.70] (And if you're serious)
[03:00.47] (And if you're serious)
[03:05.37] You just gotta choose if you're serious
[03:09.03] (And if you're serious)
[03:17.78] (And if you're serious)
[03:22.72] You just gotta choose if you're serious
